    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p>I have always striven to learn all the skills needed to create and maintain web applications. Since 2008 I've been freelancing full-time, working for established corporations like Sage Software North America and startups like InputHealth.com. I've worked with all aspects of web software from designing user flows and formulating requirements to monitoring performance in live product.</p>

    <p>Now I'm building full software products. I'm looking to create products with great user experience – code and frameworks and architecture are just tools to get there.<p>

    <p>I'm looking join or taking over complex Ruby Rails project (Rails both for backend and front-end). Let's exploit over 10.000 hours experience I have with this awesome framework! I'll be happy to wrap my head around complex business scenarios, use profiler to find performance bottlenecks and optimize them with surgical precision, without breaking legacy code.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Rapid prototyping with Twitter Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Augmenting Rails front-end Backbone</li>
      <li>Responsive design</li>
      <li>Performance monitoring and optimization</li>
      <li>Web design (Photoshop)</li>
      <li>Basic Linux server maintenance</li>
      <li class="text-muted">Facebook React (soon)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm working with Ruby on Rails continuously, starting with version 2.1 in 2008. I've never shied from diving into Rails core and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/14140">contributing patches</a>.</p>

    <h2>Work History</h2>

    <h3 id="shootzilla">ShootZilla</h3>
    <h5>(Jan 2013 – Jan 2016)</h5>

    <p>Built complete SaaS product: front-end and back-end, prototyping, performance optimization, server monitoring – whatever was needed to provide users with good UX. Started by shipping an MVP in couple days and then added features iteratively until it didn't resemble the MVP anymore. Used Ruby on Rails to the fullest, to focus on shipping features and not experimenting with my own technical stack. I made all the decisions when to refactor and when to cut corners and worked with the same code two years later. This gave me great insight into which investments in code quality and architecture pay off in the long run.  Responsibilities included challenging requirements and basking in positive feedback from happy customers.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Wojtek is a developer with great communication skills and high integrity. He build my saas for photographers ShootZilla from the ground up and it rocks.
      During the time that I worked with Wojtek (1,5 years now and I don't want it to end any time soon) I got to know him as a dedicated professional. Always looking for the best coding solution for a problem. And even in the rare cases when he does not have the required skills he would not shy away from researching (in his own time) how he can implement a solution with the required skills. 
      He is proactive in communicating when he is available or when not around. And when coding the application he always reaches out when questions arise so progress is not at stake and assumptions are not made. 
      When I didn't have time to create mockups for a certain feature, Wojtek delivers those themselves and they are usually better than what I would have created. 
      Wojtek methodology is lean and quick and thorough.  What else can I say... Consider yourself lucky if Wojtek wants to work on your app ;-). 
      Feel free to connect with me for any references!

    <h3 id="healthism">Healthism Labs</h3>
    <h5>(March 2012 – January 2013)</h5>

    <p>Built first version of questionnaire editor for InputHealth.com (Rails), automated generating mobile applications for generated questionnaires with PhoneGap. Prototyped integration with Microsoft HealthVault. Ensured HIPAA compliance. Prototyped data storage with asymmetric encryption, where only customers have decryption key in their mobile app.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Wojtek is an excellent developer with great work ethic, integrity and communication skills. Wojtek has helped us get first MVP of a mobile app building platform out the door: built server-side part of the system that already powers several mobile applications, prototyped integration with Microsoft HealthVault and encryption of sensitive health information using assymetric key cryptography. Along the way he tried to convert us to practices like Test Driven Development and continuous deployment. I have no reservations whatsoever recommending him for anyone seeking a talented and passionate software engineer with a diverse skill set.

    <h3 id="sage">Sage Software North America</h3>
    <h5>(June 2009 - August 2011)</h5>

    <p>
      Took over maintenance of a legacy invoicing application Sage Billing Boss. Added features on an application that thousands customers trusted with their financial data. Practiced forensic science with Git, digging out commits from years back to uncover intentions behind code changes. Worked in a team distributed across four time zones (mostly US-East and US-Pacific). Participated in designing and developing Payment Boss for mobile payments, project management and time tracking tool with integrated invoicing and other projects that were later merged into Sage One.

      Wojtek is a good developer who is self driven, creative and passionate about the quality of work he delivers. We had the pleasure to work with him on a few projects and he had made major contributions in all projects.

    <blockquote>
      Wojtek is a pro: he figures the job out, gets it done, and communicates well throughout. He takes on complex projects and helps simplify them. Although he worked with us remotely, he felt local. It's always a pleasure to work with him.

    <h3 id="leapfile">LeapFile</h3>
    <h5>(May 2008 – March 2009)</h5>

    <p>My first job for a Silicon-Valley based start-up. Built front-end for file upload application (AJAX upload with progress bar, back when it was still difficult). Built a tool to quickly create and easily manage customized file exchange portals for customers in Drupal CMS.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Wojtek is an expert web developer with a great eye for design...not just a developer who knows how to use Photoshop. He is able to implement complex projects, write clean code, and self-impose debugging and error-checking practices. I only wish that I had him working on our projects full-time rather than part-time.

    <h3 id="oxos">Self-employed</h3>
    <h5>(2007 – present)</h5>

    <p>In 2007 I started freelancing full-time. First web-mastering with Drupal, web design and even some DTP, gradually moving to complex software development. Hired and managed one full-time employee, trained him with Ruby on Rails and software engineering practices, brought him on-board Sage Software N.A. and then coached him.</p>

    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>

    <h3>Computer Science (Software Engineering)</h3>
    <h5>(2003 – 2007)</h5>

    Studied at University of Zielona Góra. Benefited most from first years when we learned everything but software engineering: advanced math, statistics, designing integrated circuits, some robotics, machine learning with MatLab. Received academic scholarship throughout my stay. However Amazon library turned out to be better source for learning actual modern Software Engineering, so I left before getting a degree.
