    <h3>Feature highligts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wedding photographers have
        <strong>complex workflows</strong>.
        <strong>templates</strong>
        and allows photographers to create tailored worfklows for their needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        ShootZilla's dashboard is one of rare examples of Dashboards that are actually useful. Horizontal position of task label combined with color gives photographer an overview of each job's status.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some tasks need to be performed on specific days (like cleaing lenses day before shooting) while others can be grouped for effciency (sending contracts, following up on emails). Tasks pane suggests what to do based on your context (e.g. "in front of the computer").
      </li>
      <li>
        Workflow tasks can have emails. When task becomes due an email is generated and added to the queue for review. Photographer can tweak emails or just send them all with one click.
      </li>
      <li>
        Links to forms branded with photographer logo can be added to scheduled emails. When submitted those forms fill out job, contact and lead information within ShootZilla saving photographer from copying and pasting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Photographers configure rules for their preferred availability, like "no more than 2 weddings a week" with manual overrides for holidays. Then they see at a glance how booked they are for a given month and what's their availability for a given date.
      </li>
      <li>
        When photographer has to turn down a customer they can search ShootZilla Marketplace for photographers available on this date. While searching ShootZilla considers considers their calendar (preferred availability settings, manual exceptions and booked shoots), distance from shoot location and budget.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>One man development team</h3>
    <p>
      Thanks to amazing technologies like Ruby on Rails I was able to build and maintain ShootZilla myself, working directly with the founder.
      With
      <a href='http://getbootstrap.com' target='_blank'>Twitter Bootstrap</a>
      I could quickly protype and ship esthetic UIs
      while
      <a href='https://shellycloud.com' target='_blank'>Shelly Cloud</a>
      platform took care of the servers and
      <a href='http://newrelic.com' target='_blank'>NewRelic</a>
      monitored performance.

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>
      Building product this way was possible because of founder
      <a href='https://twitter.com/eedebee' target='_blank'>Esther de Boer</a>
      who fearlessly put prototypes in front of users to gather feedback, was open to tradeoffs that allowed faster iteration and generally embraced Lean Startup ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also my rudimentary design skills could take us only so far and half a year after launching we got brilliant new
      <a href='http://www.hornadam.com/75598/2121439/index/shootzilla-id'>visual identity</a>
